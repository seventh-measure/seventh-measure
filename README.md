- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @seventh-measure

I'm a simple hobbyist trying to maintain what skill I have in coding.

Currently, I'm working on a Spotify playlist maker, ~~using a "Seed Playlist" method~~ that interacts with Spotify's Web API and their metadata associated with the music. The project is now focused on rehashing an older idea based around clustering. I have no experience with these kind of algorithms so progress is slow. This project is inspired by the work of Glenn Mcdonald and Every Noise at Once.
